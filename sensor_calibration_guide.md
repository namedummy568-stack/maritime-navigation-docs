# GPS Sensor Calibration Guide

This guide outlines the steps for calibrating GPS sensors in maritime navigation systems.

## 1. Preparation
- Ensure the vessel is in a stable, open area with clear sky view.
- Verify all GPS hardware connections are secure.
- Have the latest firmware for the GPS module readily available.

## 2. Calibration Procedure

### 2.1 Static Calibration
1. Power on the GPS system.
2. Allow the GPS receiver to acquire a stable fix (typically 5-10 minutes).
3. Record the GPS coordinates from the system.
4. Compare these coordinates with a known, highly accurate reference point.
5. If a discrepancy is observed, adjust the system's offset parameters according to the manufacturer's instructions.

### 2.2 Dynamic Calibration (if applicable)
1. Perform slow, controlled maneuvers with the vessel (e.g., slow turns, straight lines).
2. Log GPS data during these maneuvers.
3. Analyze the logged data for consistency and accuracy, especially during changes in direction.
4. Adjust dynamic compensation parameters as needed.

## 3. Verification
- After calibration, perform a series of test runs.
- Compare GPS readings with other independent navigation systems (e.g., DGPS, RTK if available).
- Document all calibration parameters and results.
